# Reflection

Well, here we go, the final project for this semester. I guess I'll just jump right in. 

I think I completed most of what I set out to do other than adding in the phaser design aspects. I struggled with the screen management for start game, level up, and reset, and found myself content to get that working. 

That was probably my biggest challenge which eventually had me restructuring my whole code to get a better look at the logic. From there, it was a couple of small issues that chatgpt helped me spot: the main one was back in the html and I had to set the display to block since I had adjusted it in my css. Then tie in the css into the js like last time, which solidified everything. From there it was pretty smooth sailing. 

Literally, I smoothed out the movement. The movement stays smooth throughout the levels and on the third level, the player is able to smoothly move in all directions. This was my next biggest accomplishment that took a good bit. But, we got there. At one point, I was being redrawn to the left each time because I had repeated my move left just in a weird way for the following levels. But, got it figured out! 

But then, the falling objects wouldn't reset after the end of the game, causing the start over to go way too fast. This may have been funny, but was obviously not functional or reasonable. So got this settled out by adding speed variables and checkpoints and then integrating these into the proper spaces. Then it was finished after making sure the game didn't continue behind the pop up screens and after that was solidified, I was pretty content for now. 

If I were to continue adding to it, I would begin to add in additional design effects and possibly animations. Maybe power-ups? But I am unsure of that would make sense for a game like this, at least as of now. Well, I could make a ten second invisible power up for the third level, or other similar ideas. A power up that slows down the obstacles? And then maybe begin to change the size of the obstacles throughout the level, but these are just ideas I had. 

Otherwise, I think this captures the semester pretty nicely. It's super neat to have a fully coded game like this.

This week has been a challenge, but I am grateful to finish strong. This whole semester has been a lesson in trusting the unknown, and yet here I am, with a completed game I would have never thought possible prior to these past 15 weeks. 

Thank you so very much for your time and energy throughout the semester. Thank you for teaching us skills that I will keep with me for the rest of my forseeable future, I am excited to continue building upon them. 

Well, I guess that's about it. 

Cheers. 

Best wishes and warmest regards,
