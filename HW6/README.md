# Reflection 

This assignment certainly took me a bit longer. I broke it up into chunks, going step by step. And that was was definitely the way to go I believe. 

Let me preface, it doesn't load properly in my browser sometimes, but then when I work with it on a live server through VSC, it works every time. AI said this could be for many reasons, but as long as it works in the live server, then it should be correct? I believe it may because of my security measures on my laptop, but I didn't know how to change this without messing with the rest of my security, and I apologize if it doesn't meet everything due to this (it does work in chrome, just not firefox). I would be very curious how to fix it without sacrificing my security measures.

I started with creating the first page and associated form, building the form.js to hold the players information. At first, I began crafting my js in the same files, and with the help and clarity of AI, quickly switched to building my game.js file in another location to help keep everything clean and separated. Then when I finalized that js, I completed it's associated gameover.html file. 

From there, I started to break down the game js. I had to go step by step, debugging each block of logic, trying to figure out if each step was solid enough to support my move. This way however, definitely helped me to see and implement what needed to get done with greater clarity. AI also helped to figure out why the code wouldn't work, helping me refine my console.logs to give better feedback. 

I left the console.logs in to show how they were helping my thought process, checks and balances along the way, for sure. AI really helped me refine flipping the cards over and keeping the matching pairs flipped over. Reworking my grid to allow for matches to stay up front, we built in the console logs to help debug why the images weren't flipping at first. Then the other biggest help from ai was helping me handle mismatched cards and that associated logic. I had some rough if, else statements, but they weren't in a logical flow to allow everything to connect. Once I learned that I had to keep it all in the same loop, things began to run quicker and smoother. Finally, when prompted to move my entire code into the domeventlistener, that's when I found success. 

When I prompted ai to build the whole thing from scratch, it made something kinda functional, but certainly different from mine. It did again use the fisher-yates algorithm for randomness as well. Overall it made sense, but was certainly different from how I saw it in my mind's eye. More disconnected? I can see my logic, I couldn't quite see its. 

I think I found the best success in having it help me check each step, and debugging it through and through. I am beginning to see the blocks of logic with greater clarity in comparison to before. I am still missing some small factors (for example, I used firstSelection.index at first rather than firstSelection.dataset.index, and that is what AI helped me to catch). But overall, I think it's pretty neat to be able to see the building blocks more clearly in my mind than before. 

Moving forward, I am excited to see how these logical building blocks will continue to build upon each other. It feels like a game in and of itself - trying to figure out if it'll lead how I intend it to. I'm a bit nervous by the complexity of it, however, breaking it down into littler steps was definitely manageable and my game plan moving forward. I can't always see the whole picture at first, especially when it's a larger picture, but I can see how one piece should connect to the next, eventually connecting them all into a larger picture. Then double checking to make sure everything is still cohesive. It was a neat perspective shift that I am excited to explore. 

Otherwise, I am excited to continue forward! 

Thank you for your time and energy, 

Cheers!
