# Reflection

Well, so we begin the final project. For this, I wanted to stay similar to my old games to continue working on solidifying concepts, but just adding a bit of flair. I don't feel entirely confident submitting to the gaming expo so I'm not sure if I will, but it's still fun to create with user's in mind. 

This is my minimum viable product/ check-in. There are a few things that I would like to add to it and I will get into those in a minute, but first I wanted to address the new concepts that chatgpt helped me figure out. To add new obstacles each time, I struggled with getting clean stylized objects along with figuring out the math in relation to the boundaries. This is where chatGPT helped me logically organize my code with properly matching mathematical elements to fit within the boundaries. Then it introduced the css into the javascript so the stylized versions would work with each newly created object. I thought this was interesting because it makes sense now that it's in and functioning, but was definitely something that threw me off at first. Other than that, I tried to recreate old projects code, focusing on solidifying previous concepts. 

Moving forward, these are my ideas. I'm thinking that the obstacles could speed up slightly after a successful acquisition of passing every ten objects. After a hundred is hit, the game will pause (?) and move to the second level. Here, the player will get slightly smaller and the obstacles will continue to increase slightly in speed after each ten points are acquired. The final, and third level, the player will stay small, but will have a full range of motion (up and down as well as left and right) because the pieces are moving so quick. 

With the increase of speed, I am also aiming to smooth out the movement when the arrow keys are held down. And possibly change shapes of the obstacles in the third and final level. This level will not have a point max, and the high score will be based on how long they can last/ the highest points acquired. 

I would like a final score to display at the end in a better pop-up along with keeping a high score on the screen for future plays. With this, I would like to clean up the display a bit, having an official start screen without showing the game canvas. Only after pressing start will the canvas appear. Then at the end, instead of a window pop-up, display a final screen with high scores and a restart button. I was thinking about adding in a pause button, but am unsure. 

Regarding design and UI, I would like to clean it up and make it a bit fancier if time allows. I was thinking about adding in some phaser objects, I think that would keep it fun and more engaging. But I will work on the aforementioned pieces first as they have to do with the functionality of the game to begin with. 

I think that is about all for now, I'm excited to add some more challenges in and work on developing a single project into something more complicated. I must admit that I am still slightly intimidated by it all, but I've grown to really appreciate the challenge and creating things I didn't think were possible of my current self. I'm excited to continue exploring it all moving forward in this next season of life. 

Thank you for your time, energy, and assistance, I've really appreciated this class. 

Sincerely,
