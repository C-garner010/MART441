# Reflection 

This assignment was fun and unique for me, as someone who had yet to work with jQuery I found the experience fun to tweak and work with. I can see how it makes a much longer JS logic statement into more manageable and comprehensive statements. 

In building the basic logic, I found that I struggled getting the css aligned with it all for some reason, but eventually got there! My main challenge with infusing the styles was making sure all the images were centered and proportionate. Then I went to make them responsive in addition to the fade attributes. 

I did better at working with a smaller data set before adding in additional material until after the logic was more solidified. I did this with both the images and the text which made the process a bit smoother since I wasn't overwhelmed with too much at once. 

After finalizing these, tweaking the timing of it all, then I began working on the moving shapes - the dots. I started with a single one, aiming to have it move randomly. Once that was fulfilled, I wanted it to move along the border. I figured out how to do this with the help of chatGPT. Getting the timing and proportions correct. Then I wanted multiple dots. At first, they kept creating themselves so eventually it was a consistent, random creation of dots flowing along the border. It was kind of fun to watch, but it wasn't controlled. So we worked to tweak it into the ones that make a rotation and then fade out by the end. Then, a new dot is created, crafting what looks like a seamless flow of four dots, but it's actually new dots each cycle. 

I also used chatGPT to help me create randomized colors with the dots, and I thought that was super cool and fun. I understood the logic eventually, but this randomization of colors was certainly one I couldn't figure out on my own. Now that I see it's functionality, the pieces pull together with greater clarity which feels incredibly neat.

The final piece that I added was the animation and movement of text. I used chatGPT to assist with this as well, but seemed to struggle a bit more in figuring out how to make it all smooth. I couldn't entirely understand the logic to find my missing details. The main help from chatGPT here was getting the text to stop overlapping on itself. I couldn't figure out why it was and I'll admit that I still don't quite understand how/ why. This would be one of the next key features I continue to aim tweaking, hoping to figure out how to 'smooth-ify' the process. But for now, I think it works as a minimum viable product? 

Moving forward, I am excited to integrate this knowledge into future pieces. It's exciting to add tools to my toolkit. I don't know what future pieces I'll create, but I'm excited to know that they will be cooler and more extensive than I ever originally thought possible. 

As always, I will need to continue focusing and giving additional attention to the small details and nuances that bring the complete picture together. I get excited and start going too fast, missing some of the small but key details. This causes additional work, time, and effort in going back and trying to find/ fix these small details. I'm sure that comes with the territory of being an amateur, but that also feels like the exciting part. Becoming so curious you forget the small details that are not yet ingrained. But then when I see them and do fix them, that's also extremely satisfying. 

This assignment helped to redefine my joy in developing. I can find an escape in the puzzle of it, and quite enjoy that. I don't find that in many places outside of my writing, so it's neat to have a new opportunity like such. 

Thank you. 

Sincerely.
