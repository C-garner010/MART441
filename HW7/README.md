# Reflection 

This assignment may have been my smoothest one yet! Everything began to fall into place and I was able to connect it all visually within the mind's eye so that was exciting! 

I began with saved photos and realized I had to go back and attach URL's, but that was probably my only miss-step. Everything felt (for the first time) to make complete, logical sense! 

I think my next step is learning how to expand these logical concepts into a cohesive experience. I know that is probably the next step in general, and I admit I am a bit anxious for it. But, learning how to build it each piece at a time is certainly the way to go it seems. 

I think the only thing that comes to mind is exploring the fisher-yates randomization because I've realized that the images don't shuffle as randomly as I would hope. Certainly something I would address down the road which was why I wanted to leave it in the reflection. 

Overall, I don't have much else to add for this week, I felt pretty solid which was new. I am excited to continue expanding on a more comprehensive understanding of building full sites rather than only the front-end. 

Cheers, 

Thank you, 

Sincerely.
