# Reflection

I'll be honest in my struggle of this assignment. I spent more hours than I'd like to admit, writing code that never saw the light of day. I began with a rather obscene amount of else if loops, rewriting the same code over and over. After I realized I wasn't finding success, I turned to ChatGPT to help me reach a more concise code. 

Its take on the assignment was not proper, just like the first few times. What I ended up doing was posting my code, and then asking it where I could improve. I found this wildly helpful because it would explain some of the smaller nuances that I struggled with finding and defining. 

When I developed a MVP, I tried to mess with some more small details and ended up messing up the MVP. This required me to rework the entire code again. For example, I tried to add in prompts to the textbox at each different stage, and did not find success. I had to abandon a few hours of effort because when I would tweak one thing, many things would change and I couldn't figure out why. 

I found ChatGPT to be helpful in showing me that my ideas are possible, but not in the genuine execution of such ideas (through the use of ChatGPT). We went back and forth for many hours trying to find all the small bits, but eventually my frustration got the best of me and I gave up (for now). 

Another large frustration of mine was trying to figure out how to get all the pictures to work. I unfortunately was unable to figure it out and no AI could help pinpoint why. Granted, I probably should have started with a smaller data set, however, I couldn't get my brain around the code's MVP without a larger data set. I couldn't see how it would work cohesively without the additional prompts/ ideas. Every time I'd ask (any) AI for an explanation as to why, they kept giving me the same answers every time. Although I did what I could, I couldn't understand what small piece I was missing in relation to it all. 

One piece of assistance from ChatGPT that I did end up keeping was the timing reset effect at the end of the endGame options. I didn't know how to do this, but I wanted the product to define the ending and not just leave it up to the user's guess. This took me a few more hours to refine and get working, but I think I found slight success, even if it's not perfect (probably, in the slightest). My least favorite part is still that prompt within the textbox at the end, the user is unable to enter any more prompts, it still asks for the final one before resetting itself, and if I had more time and knowledge this would be a piece that I would fix. 

I would also fix, if the user gives the wrong input, then it wouldn't take away the original prompt when asking for them to try again. 

I think my largest frustration with this assignment was trying to get the images to work. I really tried my best, so many times, and still couldn't get them right. Even ChatGPT said my code seemed correct and because I don't have enough experience with troubleshooting, I couldn't figure out how to pinpoint what needed fixing. I tried downloading a live server on vsc because GPT said that there was a networkerror on retrieving my images, but then that still didn't work. 

HAZAAAAAA after a few more hours of frustration, I have achieved at least some images popping up! There are still certainly tweaks I could make, but my frustration has gotten the best of me this week so I will take this win for now! I'd like to fix it so the first image resets with the whole game, but that sounds like a sisiphian task right about now. I will count my wins where I can get them! 

Well, I might have gone and done it. I think that's finally all she wrote (for now). 

Thank goodness.
