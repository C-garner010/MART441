# Reflection

This week was a bit easier trying to figure out. I am excited to see how this game progresses. 

After working and comparing with generative AI here are my thoughts: 

It consistently recommended using a Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm instead of a sort method. I did not end up using this because I could not understand it, however, I did change my math.random to -.5 instead of *10. I didn't know why this mattered at first, but then with the assistance of generative AI, learned that the negative numbers were necessary for a more complete randomization. Generative AI did say that the Fisher-Yates algorithm would provide an even more accurate randomization, but again, didn't quite understand how it worked. 

It also helped me realize I needed to cut down from 12 unique images down into six so I could have those repeating ones for the matching game later on. Which helped me create the six paired unique images. 

I had forgot the img.dataset.index = i;, the '...' in front of uniqueImage for the actualImage variable, and 'this' in front of src, and generative ai helped me to pull these small bits together along with css styles to make the grid more reasonable and functional. I am keeping some css in from the last assignment to help design the cards further down the road. 

Overall I found my understanding of this assignment to be the most comprehensive yet, so that was exciting. I've found the additional reading and code (& kahn) academy run through(s) to be incredibly helpful. Solidifying a shaky understanding into a visual comprehension of how the bits add together. 

My comprehensive understanding is certainly expanding which has been my greatest excitement. I'm still struggling with debugging my little missing pieces, but this week definitely helped me find new ways to look for those tiny missing pieces. My goals moving forward include gaining greater visual comprehension of the complete picture and continuing to work towards a development in confidence of my new skills. 

Thank you for you time and energy, I am quite enjoying the development of understanding and the opening of creative possibilities. 

Cheers!

Thank you again.
