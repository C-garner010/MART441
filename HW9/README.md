# Reflection

This next step was certainly a bit of a challenge for me, but in a good way. It is fun to start putting all the small pieces together, but until I continue to work with it, I have yet to really begin seeing it all collectively in my mind's eye. This week obviously had a ton of new information that'll take me a bit to digest. 

I do see the benefits of using jQuery, JSON, and ajax moving forward, even if it'll take me a bit to process it all together at first. I had chatGPT compare and contrast my completed code with a javascript version of the same concepts and I was definitely a bit astounded that it took that much more javascript to complete the same concepts. 

Then in asking it to describe the benefits of jquery/ json compared to js, it stated reasons like: simplicity and readability, cross-browser compatibility, ease of integration, chaining and plugins. Most of which I already knew, but seeing it so prominently definitely solidified my understanding of why choosing jquery/ json moving forward, in addition to js, is so beneficial. 

As always, I made small syntactic errors that wouldn't allow my code to run at first. Going to chatgpt for help, we ended up figuring it out after a couple of hours, but I left the associated console.logs in to help me in the future, see how we went through that process. 

Otherwise it felt more straightforward than what I was preparing myself for. I've worked with API's in a past course, so the mindset and perspective was stronger than I originally remembered. For these reasons, I wanted to spend some more time with CSS as I am preparing to publish my personal blog this coming summer. I do quite enjoy putting those design pieces into play, there's something very satisfying in getting the positioning and colors just right and such. 

I am super stoked to start seeing how all the pieces could work for myself, in addition to future career moves. I don't know entirely where I would like to sit when it comes to design and development, but at least for my personal site/ portfolio I can do really whatever I'd like which is certainly freeing to feel. 

Even though my major is in communications, I think my heart lies here. I know that's not wildly important for this assignment, but it's been something I've been thinking about a ton and just felt like I needed to acknowledge it for myself. I used to struggle a ton with social communication and I've certainly grown in that aspect so it doesn't feel like a "waste" per se, but career wise, I do not wish to spend my time making money in fields like PR or HR. They sound quite brutal to my design and ideation favoring mentality. 

And I think this assignment really helped to bring conscious awareness to this new understanding of mine. Thank you for your own creativity and energetic inspiration, it is witnessed and wildly appreciated. 

Sincerely,
