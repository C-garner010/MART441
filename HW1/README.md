# Reflection 

To begin, I'll admit I didn't know how to get my README and my index.html on the same level as HW1. I created the HW1 folder to work within, and then was confused about why that isn't the proper way/ wouldn't work and how to then get the other files back out of the folder? I tried to have ChatGPT explain it, but it ended up sending multiple error codes instead.

I noticed that I am definitely a bit rusty after not really coding for five months. This site took me longer than I expected, but I also found a great deal of satisfaction in just being back. I couldn't get out of my mind's anxiety until I started working on the project, and suddenly after a few hours, noticed I was no longer thinking about and overthinking the silliness. I remembered thinking that the feeling felt like my brain was a dirty rag and after the project, I'd rung out all the dirty water and was able to leave a quiet and clean brain to sun dry. Sounds silly, but it felt a bit epiphanic in a way. Coming back to this environment feels like I'm exactly where I need to be. I can really see myself pursing web development & design as a career, and I'm just so excited haha! 

Otherwise, for this assignment, I believe I refigured out how to have decent desktop breakpoints. But when I went into the inspect elements and checked my mobile version, it was not up to par unfortunately. Definitely a piece that I'll have to spend some time revisiting. 

My other challenge I ran into for this assignment was trying to add an opacity to my text boxes without affecting the text within them as well. I tried to add it into my rbga value, but it still wouldn't process properly. Another piece I will continue spending time working through.

Overall, it certainly took me more time than I'd like to admit to remember the order of things and all the necessary pieces I needed to add in, but I still arrived somewhere! I doubt my css is in the best and most proper order, but then again, if it works it works I suppose. 

My immediate goals moving forward include regaining a working understanding of HTML and CSS. I am nervous about JavaScript, over the summer, I definitely leveraged the provided helphub so I'll go ahead and preface that I am looking to schedule some office hours moving forward with the semester so I can achieve a genuine understanding of JS. 

This assignment was a fun way to get back into the swing of things, I am excited to experience what the rest of the semester has in store! I hope this is what is expected of the README. I know my frustrations and misunderstanding will be more prominent in the coming weeks, but for now, I feel relatively confident with this starting point!

Cheers, thank you!!
