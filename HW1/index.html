            <h3>Information about Caiia</h3>
            <p>Hello world! My name is Callan, but I usually go by Caiia. I have begun my senior year after working towards a Bachelor's in Communication and a Web Design & Development certificate. I am expected to graduate in December of 2025; therefore, less than 365 days now! It has been an experience to say the least. Lot's of ups and downs. But, this blend has finally begun to feel like it`s the right fit for me and my future, which has been exciting to experience. I aim to work fully online someday (hopefully soon) and am wildly excited to continue getting closer to my dreams and goals!</p>
            <p>I don't have any real-world coding experience (yet) and I admit this is only my third class with it - especially as a Communications student. But, I have really begun to fall a bit in love with this knowledge and skill set and can see myself pursuing a more web based career with communication perks rather than the other way around. The last development course I took was over the summer, so I am a bit nervous to see how well my recall and comprehension stands, but I am excited to see where I'll be by the end of the semester!</p>
            <p>My favorite part of it all may be the final design aspects and details that come together by the very end. It is usually a decent bit different from the initial idea, but, I think that's the best part!</p>
            <p>I have many (kind of ridiculous) ideas, but they lead my inspiration and motivation forward and that is probably the largest factor as to why I am so interested and inspired by web development. It's neat to see ideas come to life once every piece begins to come together. I enjoy the puzzle of it all, even if it is frustrating at times.</p>

           <h3>A backstory?!</h3> 
            <p>My story is riddled with twists and turns, peaks and valleys; only a culmination of my time could accurately capture all the reasons why I am here today.</p>
            <p>But, there are a few important and key reasons that'll I'll share as of now</p>    
            <p>Nearly three years ago, I was diagnosed as Narcoleptic. Years of struggle finally began to 'make sense' - as much as living with an undiagnosed sleep disorder could. However, as time continued to pass - like it always does - I found that something I once saw as a shackle on my spirit, turn into a doorway into the unknown. I know that sounds cheesy at worst and 'woo-woo' at best, but embracing the unknown has been one of the best mindset shifts  I've ever been able to experience.</p>
            <p>Instead of fighting my literal sleep demons (howdy Nigel), I could embrace and learn from them. Pushing past that fear may have been one of the hardest things I've had to do yet. Once I learned how to listen to my mind, body, and spirit, my external reality began to mirror said shift. I went back to school after dropping out in 2019, I figured out a career path that seemed even just a bit exciting, and I found this exciting personal and professional puzzle that really, never ends.</p>
            <p>My favorite puzzles/ games growing up were Sudoku, Chess, and Scrabble; thrilling, mmh, totally, I know. I highly enjoy cinematography and found these games to be playable with said films in the background. As I've grown into my adulthood, I've taken to card games in almost any social setting. I have found them to be a great source of connection: a good round of Gin Rummy seems to take our family from tired and quiet, to smiles and laughter. I find this to be one of the best parts about games: the connection. I believe that our modern hustle culture impedes our natural human drive for play and relaxation - an inherent goal behind most games.</p>
            <p>The only reason why I haven't gotten more into online games is due to my already time-taxing hobby of watching film. A fun fact about my family is that my uncle actually helped to create Hogwarts Legacy and is currently working on the second! Prior to this game, when I was younger, he would allow my sister and I to play some of the beta versions of a few other games he and his team were working on which has always been a core childhood memory of mine. I absolutely believe that games can help us solve a variety of issues that we as a society face today. From education and learning, to connection and relationship building, I think authentic play is critical in the development of the human spirit.</p>
            <p>If I wasn't able to play and explore without fear, I don't believe I would be where I am today. I believe an honest ability to genuinely listen to different and varying perspectives is key in life, and I believe games can help us to achieve that. I believe the modern technology and information landscape can also help us achieve that, and games can help facilitate a more efficient, effective, and wider reach, strengthening a collective awareness and understanding.</p>
            <p>I mean, at this point, I see how life itself is a bit of a game and I think that perspective helps to keep a degree of distance between our dissonance and our identities. Nothing in life should be taken too seriously, and games in many forms help us to inherently understand that.</p>
            <p>Sorry for the ramble, There's something about this environment that allows the floodgates of my mind to open. Well anyways, cheers!</p>
