# Reflection 

Oh my, this assignment was definitely a bit of a struggle for me. It wasn't until it was if that makes sense. 

Let me start with saying, to get the WASD to work, you have to click in the canvas. If the user doesn't, then there's an odd error code that pops up in the bottom left hand corner that I tried to fix, but couldn't figure it out before getting too frustrated. That would be one of the first features I would try to address moving forward. 

Another feature I would address in the future is getting the shapes to stop growing in size after so many collisions. Maybe that would be "game over" ? But unfortunately my patience was tested this week with a head cold and pretty prominent brain fog, so I left it as is for now. 

The final feature that I would address moving forward is getting the border to appear. I tried many different ways, tested many different ideas, and even asked chatGPT to help figure it out, but through it all, I could not figure out how to get the gosh darn border around the canvas to appear. 

I then used chatGPT to help me figure out how to refine the autonomous movements of square2 while staying confined to the canvas along with the randomization of the background color. I know that it is certainly not perfect yet, but, it's functional I suppose. 

I did find the new tips and tricks exciting to think about for future projects. It'll be fun to incorporate HTML5 into future projects and work toward refining future (small) desktop games. This assignment definitely felt like a fun puzzle (until the brain fog hit) and it's neat to consider adding these features in future projects. Even now, it's cool to see myself creating things I didn't originally think possible, let alone consider attempting. 

Thank you for your time and energy, it's so very much appreciated. 

I apologize for not fulfilling the assignment requirements of the border. I genuinely tried my best and could not, for the life of me, figure out how to make it appear. I'm sure I'll figure it out down the road, I'll make it a priority moving forward. 

For now, I think that's about all (?). 

Thank you, sincerely.
