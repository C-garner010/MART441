# Reflection

Well, here's to another week of completing something I didn't originally think possible! How exciting! 

I believe I am starting to truly integrate the concepts into a larger picture. Starting small, building each piece one step at a time. I'll admit that at first I was a bit intimidated by this assignment, but as I went through, each step at a time, it was not nearly as bad as I had anticipated. So much so, that I went through and continued to add a few features. I am very inspired by the Mario-like game you shared with us, I'd like to go back and code along with his video in the coming weeks. I had no idea these were the initial possibilities of JS. I definitely think I do better when I see the whole picture because then I can see how everything should eventually fit together. 

After I code along with your provided video resource, I am excited to find additional projects to code along with until I am able to fully integrate it all and begin attempting larger projects on my own. Until then, I have much to think about and still learn to facilitate successful integration it all. 

After building my drafted outline, my code didn't work. At first, it was (comically) because I hadn't yet saved my collectibles.json file. I found this quite humorous because at first I became relatively frustrated until I realized it was such a silly little mistake. From there it kinda worked, but not to my preference, so I threw it into chatGPT and had it help reorder the code into proper logic structure. This was the biggest misstep on my end, I didn't realize I had gone so entirely out of order, it was definitely something I will work on in the future moving forward. From there, my collectables were regularly on top of my objects, so I also had chatGPT help me stop such prominent overlapping. 

This was a pretty minimally viable project. But due to my intrigue, I kept adding a few features. I had it help me add a bounce back effect to the player so it was more prominent when hitting an object they weren't supposed to. I also used it to help me create a tracking event to only deduct points once after hitting the object instead of continuously deducting points until the object passed through the player. From there, I used the help to generate new collectibles to continue adding to the score rather than stopping at only three. This helped me level it up into a basic game, where I then finalized with a final score and a restart button. 

One function I left in that was created by chatGPT was the promise.all function. It helped me realize some of my more nuanced mistakes while contributing to the functionality of the game. Although I don't understand its entirety, I am able to start understanding how it works with the whole picture which will be useful for future projects which is why I left it for future reference. And then that was about it!

Moving forward, I would start by refining a beginning/ instruction page for users who are unaware of the purpose and intention of the game. Defining the goals and such. I would also seek to move the obstacles around in a future level, creating a more challenging and difficult level. In addition to adding speed and objects of different sizes as well, adding to the functionality and difficulty of future levels. 

I had my sister and her boyfriend play it and they thought it was pretty neat which was cool for me to experience. I am now toying with the idea of adding in a small game to my future web design and writing portfolio simply to highlight a more personal aspect of my experience and enjoyments. I think it could highlight a more unique aspect of my "career competitiveness" in writing and design, even if its only to showcase my intrigue into different spheres and not limiting myself only to writing and design. 

Overall, I quite enjoyed this project. It was neat to really start seeing it all come together. As always, thank you infinitely for your time and energy, it's incredibly appreciated. 

Sincerely,
