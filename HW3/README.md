# Reflection

This week was definitely a bit more of a challenge for me. I found myself studying your examples daily until after a few days, I finally saw the pattern between story, choice, answer, and the next step. Once I saw the repeating pattern, I was able to understand with greater clarity what was going on, however, that clarity is still not yet crystal. 

My use of AI this week was mainly associated with asking it questions. When I prompted it to create the homework, it made something, but not something nice. The buttons would stay on the page, eventually getting in the way. Also the old ones would deactivate, but still be seen, confusing the intention of moving forward step by step. It also tried to code the whole thing in a single HTML file and would not reset/ cycle through. 

What I did find useful was it's ability to explain a line of code in depth, helping me to connect all the small points back into the bigger picture. I think my biggest challenge was figuring out where to start/ the required pattern and I found the examples to be the biggest help. I understand how each piece works individually, but by beginning to combine them into bigger pieces, I didn't feel confident at first (until I saw the pattern). Once I could see how one answer would lead to the next, or the other answer leading to somewhere else, it began to align itself with greater ease along with the next step in the progression of the story. 

I will admit that for now, my favorite bits still lie in the design aspect of it all. But I'll concede that I'm learning how to have fun with the logic, and finish with the art of it all. At this point, I'll continue to immerse myself in JavaScript because I do think that's how I learn best; seeing the whole picture and then breaking it down bit by bit. I will also continue reading eloquent Javascript to increase the immersion. I think at this point, I just need to be able to see the material everywhere to start seeing how it all comes together. 

I do think I understand the small bits, so now my goal is to work towards combining these smaller pieces to create something larger. I am still nervous and apprehensive at my basic understanding of JavaScript, but at least now I can feel the awareness and understanding beginning to descend, hinting at a closer comprehension of the material. Slowly but surely, I will continue forward in my pursuit of knowledge and aim to get closer as each week passes. It's hard not to be frustrated at my failure of true understanding, but I'm trying to trust that it will come with time. 

Otherwise, I enjoyed the challenge and was proud of the spotted pattern. 

Thank you for your time and energy this week, 

Cheers!
