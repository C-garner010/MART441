# Reflection 

This week was certainly a bit easier, but only with your help and examples. I began by trying to use cdn's because I couldn't find the referenced materials from the videos, but then in looking at the examples, saved those raw files to get everything to work. I found out that whatever cdn's I was attempting were old and broke the program. From the downloaded files, I began to find success. 

From there, it was pretty straightforward. I had the original examples all in, but everything was out of order. Here was where I used chatGPT to help organize everything logically and also help me change the color of the second cube to something more colorful. I also resized the skull and changed the plane from which it was being viewed. After those tweaks, everything fit on, and rotated properly so that was that! 

I was looking through the examples on the three.js page and was in awe by the level of detail included in them. Oh my, they are incredibly intricate, it was cool to see the capabilities of the library. But in trying to dive into it, I quickly saw that it's quite extensive and a huge beast all on it's own. It's cool to know that it's out there, but definitely intimidating to try and figure out in these early years. Certainly, something I will keep in my docket moving forward, as it is really neat. 

I appreciate being introduced to it and look forward to exploring more in the coming years. I don't know much else for this week, here's to the final stretch. Thank you for such a wonderful semester and I'm excited for our final projects!! 

Cheers!
